# Time-Python-Objects

Timing is one of the methods to ananlyze the performance of different Python's objects and methods. In this repository, I present how to use timeit to choose an efficient method

# Observations

- As the size increases, the duration of creating a list increases while the duration of the set stays the same.
- Duration of .pop(0) increases while the duration of .pop() stays nearly the same.
_ Concating is much less effective than other methods when creating a list
